"""Processes that outlive the farm's own code: runs, Remote Control, added Claudes, the UI.

Everything long-lived is started through the run shim (runshim.py), detached, with its state in files. So `clodfarm
run` can exec a new release (SIGHUP), or crash and come back, and find the same processes still running: it adopts
them instead of starting new ones. A pid alone could be reused by the system, so a process counts as ours only if
its command line still carries the marker we started it with (a run's directory, or `--tag <id>`).
